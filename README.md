# German to English Flashcard App
Flashcards made with Python (Tkinter) to help study the top 100 most frequently used words in German.

Forked from [FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords) to get the most commonly used word data.

# Usage
A list of randomized frequently used German words will pop up, and after 3 seconds the English translation will be shown. You can click the 'X' if you don't know the word, or 'âœ“' if you know it.
In the end there will be a .csv file that compiles all the words that you don't know for later study use.
